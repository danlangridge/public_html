<h2>Change is Good</h2>
<p>This is the first summer at UCR where I have not taken any summer courses. Instead, I have been working on several pet projects in an attempt to gain a better grasp at programming. 
One of these projects is called the D-engine, my attempt at making a game engine. I'll post a link here when
I start making some progress on it. I am also trying to make some additions to this bare site, possibly making it more useful to those who stumble upon it. We will just have to wait and see, hopefully, as my programming skills improve, so will this site.
